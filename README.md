# Volunteer lab exercise
Create an application that collects volunteer information and adds it to a list of volunteers.

## Requirements
1. Use data binding to retrieve values from view elements (e.g., volunteer name) and manipulate view elements (e.g., OnClickListeners).
1. Use a RecyclerView to display the list of volunteers.

## Instructions
You are given starter code so you can focus on the learning objectives of the lab exercise. You are encouraged to use the files and code already provided for you, but feel free to create your own. You will get full points as long as you follow the requirements.

### List of files with started code:
1. build.gradle (Module: Volunteer.app)
1. app > java > edu.fullerton.ecs.mdap.volunteer > MainActivity.kt
1. app > java > edu.fullerton.ecs.mdap.volunteer.adapter > VolunteerRVAdapter
1. res > layout > activity_main.xml
1. res > layout > volunteer_list_item.xml

Look at the TODO comments on the starter code to give you hints on what you need to create.
